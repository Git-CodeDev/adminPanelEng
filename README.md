Admin panel for your site, made using React.

To start using it right away, just move the build folder to your site folder (where the index.html file is) and write http://yourWebsite/build in the address bar. However, it is better to rename your folder, for example to admin, in which case you will need to write http://yourWebsite/admin.

The default password is "admin111", to change it go to settings.json in the "api" folder
